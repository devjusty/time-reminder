# TimeReminder

TimeReminder is a simple productivity tool that offers an alternative to typical timers and alarms. Receive an audible chime at the top of the hour, bottom of the hour, or on the sides (a quarter past the hour, or a quarter before the hour). Use the buttons to toggle when to receive these reminders.

## About:

After trying out the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), I found it hard to stick to the set start and stop times when I found my way into the flow state, so I searched for a simple tool to just remind me of the time. I couldn't find one, so I built it myself.

I added localStorage so that you can re-open TimeReminder and it will keep your previously active alarm toggles active.

I have already found it quite useful and hope you do too.

## Optimizations

I'd like to eventually rewrite this as an electron desktop app, or possibly port it React Native, but before that I think there are some other optimizations that can be made.

- Add an area for additional settings
- extra sound options
- dark mode
- 24-hour clock
- A visual notification during reminder
- Add other preset reminder intervals, custom reminder timers

## Updates

1.0.3
- Refactored much of the code behind the scenes
- New Feature: Remind Until - now you can set a end all reminders and hear a special new chime.
- Tweaks to design
